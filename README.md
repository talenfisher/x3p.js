# x3p.js
x3p.js is a JavaScript library for working with XML 3D Surface Profile (X3P) files.  This library was spun off from the development of [FiX3P](https://github.com/talenfisher/fix3p) with the intent to use it in other JavaScript projects. Inspired by the [x3ptools package for R](https://github.com/heike/x3ptools).
