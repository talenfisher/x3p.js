# x3p.js
x3p.js is a JavaScript library for working with XML 3D Surface Profile (X3P) files.  This library was spun off from the development of [FiX3P](https://github.com/talenfisher/fix3p) with the intent to use it in other JavaScript projects. Inspired by the [x3ptools package for R](https://github.com/heike/x3ptools).  This project follows semver and has not yet reached its first major release, so please be aware of backwards incompatible API changes until then.  

# Installation
Install x3p.js using npm or yarn:
```
npm i --save x3p.js
